<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I am <b>Ivan Jake B. Ferriol</b>, you can call me <b>Ivan</b>. 
My favorite CMSC subject so far is <b>CMSC 127</b> because it has the most number of topics 
that I think are useful in my future career as a statistician. On the other hand, my favorite GE so far is <b>ARTS 1</b> because it made me appreciate something that I normally would not look into. My favorite programming language is <b>R</b> because it is widely used and generally applicable in many of my statistics classes. My favorite food is <b>Calbee Honey Butter Potato Chips</b>.</p>
